Welcome to the WordSearch creator!
This program creates Word Search Puzzles.

The menu has four buttons which perform the following functions:
        1. New Words: Generate a new random set of words to search for.
        A text file containing words separated by newline characters called words.txt must be present in the current directory in order for this feature to work.
        2. Export: Creates a .html file containing the current Word Search grid as a HTML table, LaTeX Matrix and a String
        3. Solution: Show the location of each word on the Word Search board. Toggles on/off
        4. Reshuffle: Creates a new Word Search grid with the same words in new positions

Click the buttons on the grid corresponding to the found word to "find" words
